##  Getting Started
**I tested Tyche only on linux or mac!**

### Dependencies
Be sure you have following dependencies installed.
- git
- node 
- npm

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è
> Tyche dose not handle the authentication process for git.  
> You have to set up the ssh key to use Tyche with an repository hoster like GitLab or GitHub.  
> Have a look at the [tutorial from github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

### Initialize

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is no yet developed - see ToDo list "Initialize repository command"**
You have to initialize Tyche so it knows which repo to use.  
`node run initialize --repo=git@github.com:i5heu/Tyche-Test.git`
(`git@github.com:i5heu/Tyche-Test.git` is the test repository i use, you can have a look at it if you need a working example)

### Run

To start Tyche run:  
`npm run start`

If you want to run this in production, use something like `supervisord` or use the docker container (‚ö†Ô∏è not yet build)

### Use
